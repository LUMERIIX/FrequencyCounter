# FrequencyCounter - The most powerfull DIY FrequnecyCounter
## Introduction
FrequencyCounter is a soft- and hardware project which is a FPGA based FrequencyCounter. The FrequencyCounter is controlled by an GUI Interface ([SigrokLcd](https://github.com/LUMERIIX/SigrokLcd) )on the usb connected Host-PC. A single USB cable for Data and Power supply keeps the construction simple and clean as possible. The GUI is custom-made for this project behind the GUI runs [Sigrok](https://sigrok.org/) a open-source tool for controlling measure devices like frequency counters, multimeters, oscilloscopes etc. The project aims to be a simple, cheap, useful and accurate measure device for everyone. The layout is made in [KiCad]( http://kicad-pcb.org/) a open-source layout tool. The Project is open and everyone is wellcome to work on this project and contribute his extensions and improvements.
